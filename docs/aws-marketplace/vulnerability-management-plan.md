# ZeroTrustKerberosLink Vulnerability Management Plan

## Overview

ZeroTrustKerberosLink implements a comprehensive vulnerability management program to identify, classify, remediate, and prevent security vulnerabilities. This document outlines our structured approach to security testing, vulnerability management, and remediation processes that support our security hardening initiatives.

## Security Testing Framework

### Testing Methodology

Our security testing framework follows a multi-layered approach:

1. **Automated Security Scanning**
   - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
   - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
   - Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
   - Container security scanning
   - Infrastructure-as-Code scanning

2. **Manual Security Testing**
   - Code reviews with security focus
   - Architecture reviews
   - Threat modeling sessions
   - Manual penetration testing

3. **Continuous Security Validation**
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Pre-commit and pre-merge security hooks
   - Automated security regression testing

### Testing Frequency

| Test Type | Frequency | Scope |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| SAST | Every commit | All code changes |
| DAST | Weekly | Production-equivalent environment |
| SCA | Daily | All dependencies |
| Penetration Testing | Quarterly | Full application |
| Red Team Exercise | Annually | Full system and infrastructure |

## Vulnerability Classification

### Severity Levels

ZeroTrustKerberosLink uses the following severity classification based on the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS):

| Severity | CVSS Score | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| Critical | 9.0 - 10.0 | Vulnerabilities that can be easily exploited and result in system compromise without requiring user interaction |
| High | 7.0 - 8.9 | Vulnerabilities that can be exploited to compromise sensitive data or system integrity |
| Medium | 4.0 - 6.9 | Vulnerabilities that may be more difficult to exploit but could still lead to some compromise of the system |
| Low | 0.1 - 3.9 | Vulnerabilities that are extremely difficult to exploit and provide minimal access or information disclosure |

### Impact Assessment

Each vulnerability is assessed based on:

1. **Exploitability**: How easily can the vulnerability be exploited?
2. **Affected Components**: Which system components are impacted?
3. **Data Sensitivity**: Does the vulnerability expose sensitive data?
4. **Authentication Bypass**: Does the vulnerability bypass authentication controls?
5. **Business Impact**: What is the potential business impact if exploited?

## Remediation Process

### Remediation Timelines

| Severity | Remediation Timeline | Notification Timeline |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| Critical | 24 hours | Immediate |
| High | 7 days | 24 hours |
| Medium | 30 days | 7 days |
| Low | 90 days | 30 days |

### Remediation Workflow

1. **Identification**: Vulnerability is identified through testing or reporting
2. **Validation**: Security team validates the vulnerability
3. **Classification**: Vulnerability is classified by severity and impact
4. **Assignment**: Vulnerability is assigned to the appropriate team
5. **Remediation**: Fix is developed and tested
6. **Verification**: Security team verifies the fix
7. **Deployment**: Fix is deployed to production
8. **Documentation**: Vulnerability and fix are documented

### Exception Process

In cases where vulnerabilities cannot be remediated within the standard timeline:

1. **Exception Request**: Team requests an exception with justification
2. **Risk Assessment**: Security team assesses the risk of delayed remediation
3. **Mitigation Plan**: Temporary mitigations are implemented
4. **Approval**: Exception is approved or denied by security leadership
5. **Documentation**: Exception is documented with expiration date
6. **Tracking**: Exception is tracked and reviewed regularly

## Vulnerability Disclosure

### Responsible Disclosure Policy

ZeroTrustKerberosLink maintains a responsible disclosure policy that:

1. Provides a secure method for reporting vulnerabilities
2. Acknowledges receipt within 24 hours
3. Provides regular updates on remediation progress
4. Recognizes security researchers who responsibly disclose issues
5. Does not pursue legal action against good-faith security research

### Customer Notification

| Severity | Customer Notification Approach |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| Critical | Immediate notification with mitigation guidance |
| High | Notification within 72 hours of validation |
| Medium | Notification with next release notes |
| Low | Listed in security portal |

## Security Testing Tools

ZeroTrustKerberosLink utilizes the following security testing tools:

### SAST Tools
- SonarQube
- Checkmarx

## Penetration Testing

### Penetration Testing Scope

Quarterly penetration tests include:

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Kerberos integration points
   - AWS IAM role mapping
   - Multi-factor authentication

2. **API Security**
   - Input validation
   - Output encoding
   - Rate limiting effectiveness

3. **Infrastructure Security**
   - Network configuration
   - Container security
   - Cloud security controls

4. **Data Protection**
   - Encryption implementation
   - Key management
   - Data handling practices

### Penetration Testing Methodology

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target
2. **Scanning**: Identifying potential vulnerabilities
3. **Vulnerability Analysis**: Determining exploitability
4. **Exploitation**: Attempting to exploit vulnerabilities
5. **Post-Exploitation**: Determining impact of successful exploits
6. **Reporting**: Documenting findings and recommendations

## Security Monitoring and Reporting

### Security Metrics

ZeroTrustKerberosLink tracks the following security metrics:

1. **Vulnerability Metrics**
   - Mean time to remediate (MTTR) by severity
   - Open vulnerabilities by severity
   - Vulnerability recurrence rate

2. **Testing Coverage Metrics**
   - Code coverage by security testing
   - Component testing coverage
   - API testing coverage

3. **Security Posture Metrics**
   - Security debt
   - Security control effectiveness
   - Security incident rate

### Reporting Cadence

| Report Type | Frequency | Audience |
