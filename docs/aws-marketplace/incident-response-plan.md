# ZeroTrustKerberosLink Incident Response Plan

## Overview

This document outlines ZeroTrustKerberosLink's incident response plan for security incidents. It provides a structured approach to detecting, responding to, and recovering from security incidents that may affect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the ZeroTrustKerberosLink service or customer data.

## Incident Classification

ZeroTrustKerberosLink classifies security incidents based on severity and impact:

### Severity Levels

| Severity | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Incidents that have a severe, immediate impact on service availability or security, affecting multiple customers or exposing sensitive data | - Unauthorized access to production systems<br>- Data breach involving customer credentials<br>- Complete service outage |
| **High** | Incidents that have significant impact on service security or availability, affecting a limited number of customers | - Compromise of non-production systems<br>- Partial service outage<br>- Exposure of non-sensitive customer data |
| **Medium** | Incidents that have moderate impact on service security or availability, with limited customer impact | - Suspicious activity without confirmed compromise<br>- Minor service degradation<br>- Potential vulnerability identified in production |
| **Low** | Incidents that have minimal impact on service security or availability | - Isolated security policy violations<br>- Failed attack attempts<br>- Minor configuration issues |

### Impact Assessment

Each incident is assessed based on:

1. **Scope**: Number of affected customers or systems
2. **Data Sensitivity**: Type and sensitivity of potentially exposed data
3. **Service Availability**: Impact on service availability
4. **Recovery Complexity**: Difficulty and time required for recovery

- Documentation of systems and data flows
- Development and testing of response procedures
- Establishment of communication channels
- Regular tabletop exercises and simulations
- Deployment of security monitoring tools

### 2. Detection and Analysis

Activities to identify and analyze potential security incidents:

#### Detection Sources

- Security monitoring systems
- Automated alerts from AWS CloudWatch
- Vulnerability scanning results
- Customer reports
- Threat intelligence feeds
- Unusual system behavior

#### Initial Analysis

```
function performInitialAnalysis(incident) {
    // Gather basic information
    const initialData = {
        detectionSource: incident.source,
        timestamp: incident.timestamp,
        affectedSystems: identifyAffectedSystems(incident),
        indicators: extractIndicators(incident)
    };
    
    // Perform preliminary impact assessment
    const preliminaryImpact = assessPreliminaryImpact(initialData);
    
    // Determine initial severity
    const initialSeverity = calculateInitialSeverity(preliminaryImpact);
    
    // Create initial incident record
    createIncidentRecord({
        ...initialData,
        severity: initialSeverity,
        preliminaryImpact: preliminaryImpact,
        status: 'investigating'
    });
    
    return initialSeverity;
}
```

#### Severity Determination

The initial severity is determined based on:

1. Type of systems affected
2. Potential data exposure
3. Service impact
4. Attack sophistication
5. Potential for escalation

### 3. Containment

Activities to limit the impact of the incident:

#### Immediate Containment

```
function performImmediateContainment(incident) {
    switch(incident.type) {
        case 'unauthorized_access':
            // Revoke compromised credentials
            revokeCompromisedCredentials(incident.affectedAccounts);
            // Block suspicious IP addresses
            blockSuspiciousIPs(incident.sourceIPs);
            break;
            
        case 'malware':
            // Isolate affected systems
            isolateAffectedSystems(incident.affectedSystems);
            // Block malicious domains
            blockMaliciousDomains(incident.indicators.domains);
            break;
            
        case 'data_exfiltration':
            // Block outbound connections
            blockOutboundConnections(incident.destinationIPs);
            // Revoke active sessions
            revokeActiveSessions(incident.affectedSystems);
            break;
            
        default:
            // Apply default containment measures
            applyDefaultContainment(incident);
    }
    
    // Document containment actions
    documentContainmentActions(incident);
}
```

#### Short-term Containment

- Document system state and configurations
- Maintain chain of custody for all evidence
- Capture volatile data before system changes

### 4. Eradication

Activities to remove the threat from the environment:

#### Root Cause Identification

```
function identifyRootCause(incident) {
    // Analyze forensic data
    const forensicResults = analyzeForensicData(incident.forensicData);
    
    // Review system logs
    const logAnalysis = analyzeSystemLogs(incident.systemLogs);
    
    // Examine network traffic
    const networkAnalysis = analyzeNetworkTraffic(incident.networkCaptures);
    
    // Correlate findings
    const correlatedFindings = correlateFindings([
        forensicResults,
        logAnalysis,
        networkAnalysis
    ]);
    
    // Identify entry point and attack path
    const rootCause = determineRootCause(correlatedFindings);
    
    // Document findings
    documentRootCauseAnalysis(incident, rootCause);
    
    return rootCause;
}
```

#### Remediation Planning

- Develop comprehensive remediation plan
- Prioritize actions based on risk
- Identify required resources
- Establish timeline for remediation
- Create verification procedures

#### Remediation Execution

### 5. Recovery

Activities to restore systems to normal operation:

#### System Restoration

```
function restoreSystems(incident) {
    // Prioritize systems for restoration
    const restorationOrder = prioritizeSystemsForRestoration(incident.affectedSystems);
    
    // For each system in order
    for (const system of restorationOrder) {
        // Verify system is clean
        const isClean = verifySystemClean(system);
        
        if (!isClean) {
            // Additional cleaning required
            performAdditionalCleaning(system);
            continue;
        }
        
        // Restore from backup if needed
        if (system.requiresRestore) {
            restoreFromBackup(system);
        }
        
        // Apply security hardening
        applySecurityHardening(system);
        
        // Verify functionality
        const isFunction = verifyFunctionality(system);
        
        if (isFunction) {
            // Return to production
            returnToProduction(system);
        } else {
            // Troubleshoot restoration issues
            troubleshootRestorationIssues(system);
        }
    }
    
    // Document restoration activities
    documentRestorationActivities(incident);
}
```

#### Security Verification

- Perform vulnerability scanning
- Conduct penetration testing
- Review system configurations
- Verify monitoring and alerting
- Validate security controls

#### Phased Return to Production

- Implement heightened monitoring
- Gradually restore service components
- Verify each component before proceeding
- Monitor for signs of recurring issues

### 6. Post-Incident Activities

Activities after the incident is resolved:

#### Incident Documentation

- Complete incident timeline
- Document all response actions
- Record evidence collected
- Summarize impact assessment
- Prepare final incident report

#### Lessons Learned

```
function conductLessonsLearned(incident) {
    // Schedule lessons learned meeting
    scheduleLessonsLearnedMeeting(incident);
    
    // Prepare discussion points
    const discussionPoints = [
        'What happened?',
        'How effective was the response?',
        'What could be improved?',
        'What additional tools or resources are needed?',
        'What changes to procedures are required?'
    ];
    
    // Conduct meeting and document findings
    const findings = conductMeetingAndDocumentFindings(discussionPoints);
    
    // Identify action items
    const actionItems = identifyActionItems(findings);
    
    // Assign responsibilities
    assignResponsibilities(actionItems);
    
    // Set follow-up schedule
    setFollowUpSchedule(actionItems);
    
    // Document lessons learned
    documentLessonsLearned(incident, findings, actionItems);
    
    return actionItems;
}
```
