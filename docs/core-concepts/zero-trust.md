# Zero Trust Principles

ZeroTrustKerberosLink is built on Zero Trust security principles, which fundamentally change how we approach security by eliminating the concept of a trusted network perimeter.

## What is Zero Trust?

Zero Trust is a security framework that operates on one core principle: **"Never trust, always verify."** This approach assumes that threats exist both outside and inside the network, so no user or system should be automatically trusted.

### Core Principles of Zero Trust

1. **Verify Explicitly**: Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points
2. **Use Least Privilege Access**: Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access
3. **Assume Breach**: Minimize blast radius and segment access, verify end-to-end encryption
4. **Identity-Based Security**: Identity becomes the primary security perimeter

## Zero Trust in ZeroTrustKerberosLink

ZeroTrustKerberosLink implements Zero Trust principles throughout its architecture:

### 1. Verify Explicitly

Every authentication request is fully validated:

- **Strong Authentication**: Kerberos tickets are cryptographically verified
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Support for additional authentication factors
- **Contextual Authentication**: Authentication decisions consider device, location, and behavior
- **Continuous Verification**: Authentication state is regularly re-verified

```yaml
# Example configuration for explicit verification
authentication:
  verify_kerberos_tickets: true
  verify_ticket_encryption: true
  validate_service_principal: true
  context_factors:
    device_identity: true
    network_location: true
    time_of_day: true
    behavioral_patterns: true
```

### 2. Least Privilege Access

Access is limited to only what is necessary:

- **Fine-Grained Permissions**: Precise AWS IAM role mappings
- **Time-Limited Access**: Short-lived AWS credentials
- **Just-In-Time Access**: Access granted only when needed
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Access based on defined roles

```yaml
# Example configuration for least privilege
authorization:
  default_credential_duration: 3600  # 1 hour
  max_credential_duration: 14400  # 4 hours
  enforce_least_privilege: true
  just_in_time:
    enabled: true
    approval_required: true
```

### 3. Assume Breach

The system is designed with the assumption that breaches will occur:

- **Micro-Segmentation**: Isolation of components and services
- **End-to-End Encryption**: All data encrypted in transit
- **Limited Blast Radius**: Compromised credentials have limited scope
- **Anomaly Detection**: Monitoring for unusual patterns

```yaml
# Example configuration for breach mitigation
security:
  encryption:
    in_transit: true
    algorithm: "AES256"
  segmentation:
    network_isolation: true
    component_isolation: true
  monitoring:
    anomaly_detection: true
    unusual_access_alerts: true
```

### 4. Identity as the Primary Security Perimeter

Identity becomes the foundation of security:

- **Identity-Centric**: Authentication based on verified identities
- **Device Identity**: Consideration of device trust level
- **Contextual Identity**: Identity combined with context
- **Continuous Identity Verification**: Ongoing verification of identity

```yaml
# Example configuration for identity-based security
identity:
  primary_source: "kerberos"
  secondary_sources:
    - "device_certificate"
    - "user_context"
  continuous_verification:
    enabled: true
    interval_minutes: 15
```

## Zero Trust Authentication Flow

The Zero Trust authentication flow in ZeroTrustKerberosLink follows these steps:

1. **User Authentication**: User authenticates to Kerberos
2. **Identity Verification**: Kerberos identity is verified
3. **Context Evaluation**: Additional context factors are evaluated
4. **Policy Application**: Zero Trust policies are applied
5. **Least Privilege Assignment**: Appropriate AWS role is assigned
6. **Monitoring**: Session is continuously monitored
7. **Reauthentication**: Periodic reauthentication is required

## Implementing Zero Trust with ZeroTrustKerberosLink

### Configuration Best Practices

1. **Enable All Verification Features**:
   ```yaml
   authentication:
     verify_explicitly: true
     context_aware: true
     continuous_verification: true
   ```

2. **Implement Least Privilege**:
   ```yaml
   authorization:
     default_credential_duration: 1800  # 30 minutes
     enforce_least_privilege: true
   ```

3. **Configure Monitoring**:
   ```yaml
   monitoring:
     session_monitoring: true
     anomaly_detection: true
     alert_on_suspicious: true
   ```

4. **Enable Micro-Segmentation**:
   ```yaml
   network:
     micro_segmentation: true
     isolated_components: true
   ```

### Maturity Model

Implementing Zero Trust is a journey. ZeroTrustKerberosLink supports this journey through a maturity model:

| Level | Description | Key Features |
|-------|-------------|-------------|
| **Basic** | Initial Zero Trust implementation | Identity verification, basic least privilege |
| **Intermediate** | Enhanced Zero Trust controls | Context-aware authentication, continuous verification |
| **Advanced** | Comprehensive Zero Trust architecture | Full micro-segmentation, adaptive policies, advanced analytics |

## Zero Trust Beyond Authentication

While authentication is a critical component, Zero Trust extends to all aspects of security:

### Network Security

- **Micro-Segmentation**: Network divided into secure zones
- **Default-Deny**: All traffic denied unless explicitly allowed
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Network traffic constantly monitored

### Data Security

- **Data Classification**: Understanding data sensitivity
- **Encryption**: Data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Data access based on identity and context

### Application Security

- **Secure Development**: Security built into applications
- **Runtime Protection**: Applications protected during execution
- **API Security**: All APIs secured with Zero Trust principles

## Zero Trust and Compliance

Zero Trust principles align with many compliance requirements:

- **NIST 800-207**: Zero Trust Architecture framework
- **SOC 2**: Trust Services Criteria for security
- **HIPAA**: Protection of healthcare information
- **PCI DSS**: Cardholder data security
- **GDPR**: Protection of personal data

## Zero Trust Metrics

Measure the effectiveness of your Zero Trust implementation:

- **Authentication Success/Failure Rates**: Tracking authentication outcomes
- **Policy Enforcement**: Measuring policy application
- **Access Denials**: Monitoring access denials
- **Mean Time to Detect (MTTD)**: Speed of threat detection
- **Mean Time to Respond (MTTR)**: Speed of threat response
