# Secrets Management

Proper secrets management is a critical component of the ZeroTrustKerberosLink security model. This guide outlines the best practices and implementation details for managing secrets within the system.

## Overview

ZeroTrustKerberosLink handles several types of sensitive information:

1. Kerberos keytabs and tickets
2. AWS credentials
3. Session tokens
4. API keys
5. TLS certificates and private keys
6. Redis credentials
7. Database credentials

Each of these secrets requires careful handling to prevent unauthorized access or exposure.

## Secrets Management Architecture

ZeroTrustKerberosLink implements a comprehensive secrets management architecture based on the following principles:

1. **Least Privilege**: Secrets are only accessible to components that require them
2. **Encryption at Rest**: All secrets are encrypted when stored
3. **Encryption in Transit**: All secrets are encrypted during transmission
4. **Rotation**: Regular rotation of secrets to minimize the impact of potential exposure
5. **Auditing**: Comprehensive logging of all access to secrets

## Secrets Storage Solutions

### Integrated Vault

ZeroTrustKerberosLink includes an integrated secure vault for storing secrets. The vault:

- Uses AES-256-GCM encryption
- Implements key rotation
- Provides access controls
- Logs all access attempts

### External Vault Integration

For enterprise deployments, ZeroTrustKerberosLink integrates with external vault solutions:

#### HashiCorp Vault

```yaml
secrets:
  provider: hashicorp
  config:
    url: https://vault.example.com:8200
    auth_method: approle
    role_id: ${VAULT_ROLE_ID}
    secret_id: ${VAULT_SECRET_ID}
    mount_path: zerotrust
```

#### AWS Secrets Manager

```yaml
secrets:
  provider: aws
  config:
    region: us-west-2
    kms_key_id: alias/zerotrust-secrets
```

#### Azure Key Vault

```yaml
secrets:
  provider: azure
  config:
    vault_url: https://zerotrust.vault.azure.net/
    tenant_id: ${AZURE_TENANT_ID}
    client_id: ${AZURE_CLIENT_ID}
    client_secret: ${AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET}
```

## Encryption Key Management

### Key Hierarchy

ZeroTrustKerberosLink implements a hierarchical key management system:

1. **Master Key**: Used to encrypt data encryption keys
2. **Data Encryption Keys (DEKs)**: Used to encrypt actual secrets
3. **Key Encryption Keys (KEKs)**: Used for secure key exchange

### Key Rotation

Keys are rotated according to the following schedule:

- Master Key: Every 90 days
- Data Encryption Keys: Every 30 days
- Session Keys: Every 24 hours

### Hardware Security Module (HSM) Support

For enhanced security, ZeroTrustKerberosLink supports the use of Hardware Security Modules (HSMs):

```yaml
encryption:
  hsm:
    enabled: true
    provider: aws-cloudhsm
    config:
      cluster_id: cluster-1234567
      hsm_ip: 10.0.0.1
      hsm_username: crypto-user
      hsm_password: ${HSM_PASSWORD}
```

## Secure Configuration

### Environment Variables

Sensitive configuration should be provided via environment variables rather than configuration files:

```bash
# Example secure environment variable configuration
export ZEROTRUST_AWS_SECRET_KEY=********
export ZEROTRUST_REDIS_PASSWORD=********
export ZEROTRUST_ENCRYPTION_KEY=********
```

### Configuration File Security

When using configuration files:

1. Use restricted file permissions (600)
2. Store only encrypted sensitive values
3. Use separate files for sensitive configuration

Example secure configuration file:

```yaml
# config.yaml
redis:
  password_file: /etc/zerotrust/secrets/redis_password
  
aws:
  credentials_provider: environment
  
encryption:
  key_file: /etc/zerotrust/secrets/encryption_key
```

## Runtime Secret Handling

### Memory Protection

ZeroTrustKerberosLink implements several memory protection mechanisms:

1. **Secure Memory Allocation**: Uses secure memory allocation to prevent swapping
2. **Memory Wiping**: Clears sensitive data from memory after use
3. **Memory Encryption**: Encrypts sensitive data in memory

### Credential Caching

Temporary credentials are cached with the following security measures:

1. **Encryption**: All cached credentials are encrypted
2. **Expiration**: Cached credentials have a short time-to-live
3. **Access Control**: Cache access is restricted by user and process

## Secure Credential Transmission

### TLS Configuration

All credential transmission uses TLS with the following configuration:

```yaml
tls:
  min_version: TLSv1.2
  ciphers:
    - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
    - TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
  certificate: /etc/zerotrust/tls/server.crt
  private_key: /etc/zerotrust/tls/server.key
```

### API Security

API endpoints that handle credentials implement additional security measures:

1. **Request Signing**: All requests must be signed
2. **Rate Limiting**: Strict rate limits to prevent brute force attacks
3. **IP Restrictions**: Optional IP-based access controls

## AWS Credential Management

### Temporary Credentials

ZeroTrustKerberosLink uses AWS STS to generate temporary credentials:

1. **Short Duration**: Default credential lifetime is 1 hour
2. **Role Restrictions**: Credentials are restricted to specific IAM roles
3. **Condition Keys**: Uses IAM condition keys to further restrict access

### Cross-Account Access

For cross-account access, ZeroTrustKerberosLink implements:

1. **Role Chaining**: Securely chains role assumptions
2. **External ID**: Uses external IDs to prevent confused deputy problems
3. **Account Restrictions**: Limits which accounts can be accessed

## Audit and Monitoring

### Secret Access Logging

All access to secrets is logged with the following information:

1. **User Identity**: Who accessed the secret
2. **Timestamp**: When the secret was accessed
3. **Access Type**: Read, write, or delete
4. **Resource**: Which secret was accessed
5. **Source IP**: Where the request came from

Example log entry:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2025-05-01T12:34:56Z",
  "level": "INFO",
  "event": "secret_access",
  "user": "user@EXAMPLE.COM",
  "action": "read",
  "resource": "aws_credentials",
  "source_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "success": true
}
```

### Anomaly Detection

ZeroTrustKerberosLink includes anomaly detection for secret access:

1. **Unusual Access Patterns**: Detects access outside normal patterns
2. **Geolocation Anomalies**: Alerts on access from unusual locations
3. **Volume Anomalies**: Detects unusually high volumes of secret access

## Incident Response

### Secret Revocation

In case of a security incident, ZeroTrustKerberosLink provides mechanisms for immediate secret revocation:

```bash
# Revoke all active sessions
zerotrust-admin revoke-sessions --all

# Revoke specific AWS credentials
zerotrust-admin revoke-credentials --user user@EXAMPLE.COM
```

### Breach Notification

ZeroTrustKerberosLink includes configurable breach notification:

```yaml
security:
  breach_notification:
    enabled: true
    channels:
      - email:
          recipients:
            - security@example.com
      - slack:
          webhook_url: https://hooks.slack.com/services/T00000000/B00000000/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
      - pagerduty:
          integration_key: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

7. **Use Short-lived Credentials**: Minimize the lifetime of temporary credentials
8. **Implement Multi-factor Authentication**: Require MFA for accessing sensitive secrets
9. **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular audits of secret access
10. **Secure Backup**: Implement secure backup and recovery procedures for secrets

## Implementation Examples

### Secure AWS Credential Handling

```python
from zerotrust_kerberos import SecretManager

# Initialize the secret manager
secret_manager = SecretManager()

# Securely retrieve AWS credentials
credentials = secret_manager.get_aws_credentials(role_arn="arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/Developer")

# Use credentials (they will be automatically wiped from memory when out of scope)
with credentials as creds:
    # Use creds.access_key_id, creds.secret_access_key, creds.session_token
    pass  # Credentials are automatically wiped after this block
```

### Secure Configuration Loading

```python
from zerotrust_kerberos import ConfigLoader

# Load configuration securely
config = ConfigLoader.load(
    config_file="/etc/zerotrust/config.yaml",
    secrets_provider="hashicorp-vault",
    secrets_config={
        "url": "https://vault.example.com:8200",
        "auth_method": "approle",
        "role_id": os.environ.get("VAULT_ROLE_ID"),
        "secret_id": os.environ.get("VAULT_SECRET_ID")
    }
)

# Access configuration (sensitive values are automatically protected in memory)
redis_password = config.get_secret("redis.password")
```

## Conclusion
