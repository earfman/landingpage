# Security Hardening

ZeroTrustKerberosLink is built with security as a foundational principle. This section provides comprehensive documentation on the security features, implementation best practices, and compliance considerations.

## Security Features Overview

ZeroTrustKerberosLink implements multiple layers of security to protect your authentication infrastructure:

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Never trust, always verify approach to authentication
- **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Protection against injection attacks
- **Security Headers**: Implementation of modern security headers
- **Secure Communications**: TLS for all connections
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed logging of all authentication events

## Implemented Security Features

### Input Validation

ZeroTrustKerberosLink implements comprehensive input validation to protect against common web vulnerabilities:

- **XSS Protection**: All user inputs are sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting attacks
- **Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and input sanitization prevent SQL and command injection
- **Path Traversal Protection**: File path validation prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Content Type Validation**: Strict validation of request content types

### Security Headers

Modern security headers are implemented to enhance browser security:

- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**: Controls which resources can be loaded
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Additional layer of XSS protection
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options**: Controls iframe embedding permissions
- **Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)**: Forces HTTPS connections
- **Permissions-Policy**: Restricts browser feature usage
- **Cache Control**: Prevents caching of sensitive information

### Secure Redis Communication

For deployments using Redis for session management or caching:

- **TLS Support**: Encrypted communication with Redis servers
- **Secure Credential Handling**: Protection of Redis credentials
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient and secure connection management
- **Error Handling**: Proper handling of connection failures
- **Secure Cache Operations**: Protection against cache poisoning
