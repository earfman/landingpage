# Penetration Testing

This guide provides a structured approach for conducting penetration testing on your ZeroTrustKerberosLink deployment to identify and remediate security vulnerabilities.

## Introduction to Penetration Testing

Penetration testing is a critical component of security hardening that involves simulating attacks on your system to identify vulnerabilities before malicious actors can exploit them. For ZeroTrustKerberosLink, penetration testing should focus on:

1. **Authentication Mechanisms**: Testing the Kerberos integration and authentication flows
2. **Authorization Controls**: Verifying proper access controls and permissions
3. **Input Validation**: Testing for injection vulnerabilities and input sanitization
4. **API Security**: Assessing the security of REST endpoints
5. **Infrastructure Security**: Evaluating the deployment environment

## Penetration Testing Methodology

```bash
# Testing infrastructure security
zerotrustkerberos-cli security-test --type=infrastructure
```

### 8. Reporting and Remediation

**Objective**: Document findings and implement fixes.

**Activities**:
- Document identified vulnerabilities
- Prioritize issues based on severity
- Develop remediation plan
- Implement fixes
- Verify remediation effectiveness

**Tools**:
- Vulnerability tracking systems
- Documentation tools
- Regression testing

## Vulnerability Severity Classification

Use the following severity levels to prioritize remediation efforts:

| Severity | Description | Examples | Remediation Timeframe |
|----------|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| Critical | Vulnerabilities that can lead to system compromise with minimal effort | Authentication bypass, remote code execution | Immediate (within 24 hours) |
| High | Vulnerabilities that can lead to significant data exposure or system compromise | SQL injection, stored XSS | Urgent (within 1 week) |
| Medium | Vulnerabilities that may lead to limited data exposure | CSRF, insecure direct object references | Important (within 1 month) |
| Low | Vulnerabilities with minimal impact | Information disclosure, missing headers | Standard (within 3 months) |

## Common Vulnerability Types

### Authentication Vulnerabilities

- **Kerberos Ticket Manipulation**: Attempts to forge or modify Kerberos tickets
- **Session Fixation**: Forcing a user to use a known session identifier
- **Credential Stuffing**: Using leaked credentials to gain access
- **Brute Force Attacks**: Attempting to guess passwords through repeated attempts

### Authorization Vulnerabilities

- **Insecure Direct Object References**: Accessing resources directly through manipulation of identifiers
- **Missing Function Level Access Control**: Bypassing authorization checks
- **Privilege Escalation**: Gaining higher privileges than intended
- **Horizontal Access Control Issues**: Accessing resources of other users at the same privilege level

### Input Validation Vulnerabilities

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Injecting malicious scripts into web pages
- **SQL Injection**: Inserting SQL code into queries
- **Command Injection**: Executing system commands through application inputs
- **Path Traversal**: Accessing files outside intended directories
- **XML External Entity (XXE)**: Processing malicious XML input

### API Security Vulnerabilities

- **Lack of Rate Limiting**: Allowing excessive API requests
- **Insecure Endpoints**: Endpoints without proper authentication
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Returning excessive data in responses
- **Improper Error Handling**: Revealing sensitive information in error messages

## Penetration Testing Tools

### Built-in Tools
