## Critical and High Severity Findings

This section summarizes the critical and high-severity findings that were identified and remediated. All details have been sanitized to remove specific exploitation techniques while providing sufficient information to understand the nature of the vulnerabilities.

### Critical Findings

#### CF-1: Authentication Bypass in Kerberos Ticket Validation

**Description**: Under specific conditions, the Kerberos ticket validation process could be bypassed, potentially allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact**: An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to AWS resources by bypassing the Kerberos authentication check.

**Remediation**: Implemented comprehensive validation of Kerberos tickets with multiple verification steps and added integrity checks throughout the authentication flow.

**Status**: Remediated and verified

#### CF-2: Insecure Key Storage

**Description**: Cryptographic keys used for session token signing were stored with insufficient protection.

**Impact**: An attacker with access to the system could potentially extract keys and forge authentication tokens.

**Remediation**: Implemented secure key storage using hardware security modules (where available) or secure key management services with appropriate access controls.

**Status**: Remediated and verified

### High Severity Findings

#### HF-1: Insufficient Role Mapping Validation

**Description**: The role mapping process did not properly validate input parameters, potentially allowing privilege escalation.

**Impact**: An authenticated user could potentially manipulate role mapping to gain access to unauthorized AWS roles.

**Remediation**: Implemented comprehensive input validation, added integrity checks for role mapping data, and enhanced logging of role mapping activities.

**Status**: Remediated and verified

#### HF-2: Missing Rate Limiting on Authentication Endpoints

**Description**: Authentication endpoints lacked proper rate limiting, making them vulnerable to brute force attacks.

**Impact**: An attacker could attempt to brute force credentials or session tokens.

**Remediation**: Implemented rate limiting across all authentication endpoints with appropriate thresholds and temporary blocking of suspicious IP addresses.

**Status**: Remediated and verified

#### HF-3: Insufficient TLS Configuration

**Description**: Some components used weak TLS configurations that could potentially be downgraded.

**Impact**: Communications could potentially be intercepted through TLS downgrade attacks.

**Remediation**: Enforced strong TLS configurations (TLS 1.2+ with secure cipher suites) across all components and implemented proper certificate validation.

**Status**: Remediated and verified

#### HF-4: Insecure Direct Object References

**Description**: Some API endpoints were vulnerable to insecure direct object reference (IDOR) attacks.

**Impact**: Authenticated users could potentially access resources belonging to other users.

**Remediation**: Implemented proper authorization checks for all resource access and replaced direct references with indirect references.

**Status**: Remediated and verified

#### HF-5: Insufficient Logging of Security Events

**Description**: Some critical security events were not properly logged, limiting the ability to detect and investigate security incidents.

**Impact**: Security incidents might go undetected or be difficult to investigate.

**Remediation**: Enhanced logging across all components with particular focus on security-relevant events and implemented real-time monitoring of critical events.

**Status**: Remediated and verified
