## Introduction

### The Enterprise Authentication Challenge

Enterprises with established Kerberos authentication infrastructures face significant challenges when integrating with AWS services. Traditional approaches often require:

1. Duplicating identity stores
2. Managing multiple authentication systems
3. Creating complex federation setups
4. Compromising on security controls

ZeroTrustKerberosLink addresses these challenges by providing a secure proxy that translates Kerberos authentication to AWS IAM roles while maintaining strict security controls and Zero Trust principles.

### Solution Overview

ZeroTrustKerberosLink acts as a secure intermediary between your Kerberos infrastructure and AWS services. It:

1. Authenticates users via Kerberos
2. Maps authenticated identities to appropriate AWS IAM roles
3. Enforces fine-grained access controls
4. Provides comprehensive audit logging
5. Maintains security through Zero Trust principles

## Zero Trust Architecture

### Core Zero Trust Principles

ZeroTrustKerberosLink implements Zero Trust principles as defined by NIST SP 800-207[^1]:

1. **Verify Explicitly**: All access requests are fully authenticated, authorized, and encrypted before access is granted.
2. **Use Least Privilege Access**: Access is limited to only what is needed for the specific task.
3. **Assume Breach**: The system operates under the assumption that a breach may occur at any time, implementing segmentation, continuous verification, and minimizing blast radius.

### Architecture Implementation

Our Zero Trust architecture includes:

![Zero Trust Architecture Diagram](../images/zero-trust-flow.png)

1. **Identity Verification Layer**: Validates Kerberos tickets and performs additional authentication checks
2. **Policy Enforcement Point**: Applies fine-grained access controls based on identity, context, and resource
3. **Continuous Monitoring**: Analyzes access patterns and detects anomalies in real-time
4. **Micro-segmentation**: Isolates resources and limits lateral movement
5. **Least Privilege Enforcement**: Dynamically adjusts permissions based on the principle of least privilege

### Trust Algorithm

ZeroTrustKerberosLink uses a proprietary trust algorithm that evaluates multiple factors before granting access:

```
Trust Score = f(Identity, Context, Resource, Behavior, Time)
```

Where:
- **Identity**: Strength of authentication and user attributes
- **Context**: Device, network, and location information
- **Resource**: Sensitivity and classification of the requested resource
- **Behavior**: Comparison to historical access patterns
- **Time**: Temporal factors such as time of day and duration

Access is only granted when the trust score exceeds the required threshold for the requested resource.

## Identity and Access Management

### Authentication Flow

The authentication flow in ZeroTrustKerberosLink follows these steps:

1. User initiates authentication with Kerberos credentials
2. ZeroTrustKerberosLink validates the Kerberos ticket with the KDC
3. Additional authentication factors are verified if required (MFA)
4. User identity is established and mapped to AWS IAM roles
5. Temporary AWS credentials are issued with appropriate permissions
6. Access is continuously monitored and can be revoked at any time

### Least Privilege Enforcement

ZeroTrustKerberosLink enforces least privilege through:

1. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Users are assigned roles that define their permissions
2. **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Access decisions consider user attributes, resource properties, and environmental conditions
3. **Just-In-Time Access**: Permissions are granted only when needed and automatically expire
4. **Temporary Credentials**: All AWS credentials are temporary and short-lived
5. **Session Monitoring**: Active sessions are monitored for suspicious activity

### Identity-Aware Access Controls

Our identity-aware access controls include:

1. **User Context Evaluation**: Considering factors such as device, location, and network
2. **Adaptive Authentication**: Adjusting authentication requirements based on risk
3. **Continuous Authorization**: Regularly re-evaluating access decisions during sessions
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying and responding to unusual access patterns
5. **Granular Permission Boundaries**: Limiting the scope of access to specific resources

## Kerberos to AWS IAM Role Mapping

### Mapping Architecture

ZeroTrustKerberosLink uses a sophisticated mapping system to translate Kerberos principals to AWS IAM roles:

![Kerberos to AWS IAM Mapping](../images/role-mapping-flow.png)

1. **Principal Extraction**: Kerberos principal is extracted from the authenticated ticket
2. **Attribute Enrichment**: Additional attributes are gathered from directory services
3. **Role Determination**: Appropriate AWS IAM roles are determined based on principal and attributes
4. **Permission Boundary Application**: Permission boundaries are applied to limit scope
5. **Credential Issuance**: Temporary AWS credentials are issued for the determined roles

### Mapping Methods

ZeroTrustKerberosLink supports multiple mapping methods:

1. **Direct Mapping**: One-to-one mapping between Kerberos principals and IAM roles
2. **Group-Based Mapping**: Mapping based on group memberships in the directory service
3. **Attribute-Based Mapping**: Dynamic mapping based on user attributes
4. **Rule-Based Mapping**: Complex rules combining multiple factors
5. **Custom Mapping Functions**: Extensible mapping using custom code

### Session Management

AWS sessions created by ZeroTrustKerberosLink are managed with security in mind:

1. **Short Session Duration**: Sessions are limited to the minimum required time
2. **Session Tagging**: All sessions are tagged with user identity and context information
3. **Session Monitoring**: Active sessions are monitored for suspicious activity
4. **Session Revocation**: Ability to immediately revoke active sessions
5. **Session Isolation**: Each user session is isolated from others

## Encryption and Data Protection

### Data in Transit

All data in transit is protected using:

1. **TLS 1.3**: All communications use TLS 1.3 with strong cipher suites
2. **Certificate Validation**: Rigorous certificate validation with pinning
3. **Perfect Forward Secrecy**: Ensuring future compromise doesn't affect past communications
4. **Secure Renegotiation**: Preventing downgrade attacks
5. **HSTS Enforcement**: Preventing protocol downgrade attacks

### Data at Rest

Data at rest is protected using:

1. **AES-256 Encryption**: All sensitive data is encrypted using AES-256
2. **Key Management**: Secure key management with regular rotation
3. **Envelope Encryption**: Multiple layers of encryption for sensitive data
4. **Secure Key Storage**: Keys are stored in hardware security modules where available
5. **Data Classification**: Different protection levels based on data sensitivity

### Credential Protection

Kerberos credentials and AWS credentials are protected using:

1. **Memory Protection**: Credentials are protected in memory to prevent extraction
2. **Secure Credential Handling**: Credentials are never logged or persisted unnecessarily
3. **Credential Lifecycle Management**: Proper creation, storage, and destruction of credentials
4. **Secure Credential Transmission**: Credentials are only transmitted over encrypted channels
5. **Credential Isolation**: Separation between different users' credentials
