# ZeroTrustKerberosLink FedRAMP Ready Deployment Overview

## Introduction

This document outlines how ZeroTrustKerberosLink aligns with Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP) requirements. While ZeroTrustKerberosLink is not currently FedRAMP authorized, it is designed with FedRAMP controls in mind, making it suitable for deployment within FedRAMP boundaries.

Organizations subject to FedRAMP requirements can deploy ZeroTrustKerberosLink within their existing FedRAMP-authorized environments, leveraging our security features to maintain compliance while enabling secure Kerberos to AWS integration.

## Deployment Within FedRAMP Boundary

ZeroTrustKerberosLink can be deployed within an existing FedRAMP boundary using the following approaches:

### 1. Agency-Hosted Deployment

![Agency-Hosted Deployment](../images/fedramp-agency-hosted.png)

1. **Infrastructure**: Deployed on agency-controlled infrastructure within the FedRAMP boundary
2. **Network**: Connected to the agency's internal network with appropriate security controls
3. **Management**: Administered by agency personnel with appropriate security clearances
4. **Monitoring**: Integrated with the agency's security monitoring systems
5. **Data Flow**: All data remains within the FedRAMP boundary

### 2. AWS GovCloud Deployment

In this model, ZeroTrustKerberosLink is deployed within AWS GovCloud:

1. **Infrastructure**: Deployed on AWS GovCloud, which is FedRAMP High authorized
2. **Network**: Connected to the agency's network via secure VPN or Direct Connect
3. **Management**: Administered through secure management interfaces
4. **Monitoring**: Integrated with AWS GovCloud security services and agency monitoring
5. **Data Flow**: All data remains within FedRAMP-authorized environments

### 3. Hybrid Deployment
